## Search for recipes, bookmark the ones you like, and even upload your own

This project was created as a part of the [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/ 'Udemy') course _The Complete JavaScript Course 2022: From Zero to Expert!_ by [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://twitter.com/jonasschmedtman 'Jonas Schmedtmann on Twitter').

In this project I used:

- Model-view-controller architecture
- Object-oriented programming as well as functional programming paradigms
- AJAX calls with [Forkify API v2](https://forkify-api.herokuapp.com/v2 'Forkify API v2')
- Publisher-Subscriber Design Pattern to solve event handling problem
- [Fracty](https://npm.io/package/fracty 'Fracty Docs') NPM library to convert decimal numbers to fractions
- [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/ 'Parcel') NPM build tool for development and production
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/ 'Node.js') as a JS development environment
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/ 'Git') for version control
